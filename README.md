# Project-Mio-Pranzo
Project Name: Food Ordering and Delivery Website
# Project Description 
The project is focused on creating and maintaining a food ordering and delivery website that is easy to use and free from advertisements and loading bugs that are associated with mobile applications. Further, it helps protect the identity of the user since the information keyed-in during ordering is only submitted to the vendor, without third party accounts being involved. The menu within the site can be updated daily through Posting, patching and even deleting some of the items from the server in order to ensure that there is daily updates on the available foods. Whereas the website can work on its own, it may need connection to a working email where all the ordering details will be posted upon submission of the order and the vendors can capture the client's order, process it and make the necessary communications. A payment method as well as an order-trackibg functionality can also be incorporated as part of future modifications and improvements of the site.
